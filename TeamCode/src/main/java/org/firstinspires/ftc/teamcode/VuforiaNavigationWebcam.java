/**
 * This 2016-2017 OpMode illustrates the basics of using the Vuforia localizer to determine
 * positioning and orientation of robot on the FTC field.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * Vuforia uses the phone's camera to inspect it's surroundings, and attempt to locate target images.
 *
 * When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the
 * image relative to the camera.  This sample code than combines that information with a
 * knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera.
 *
 * This example assumes a "diamond" field configuration where the red and blue alliance stations
 * are adjacent on the corner of the field furthest from the audience.
 * From the Audience perspective, the Red driver station is on the right.
 * The two vision target are located on the two walls closest to the audience, facing in.
 * The Stones are on the RED side of the field, and the Chips are on the Blue side.
 *
 * A final calculation then uses the location of the camera on the robot to determine the
 * robot's location and orientation on the field.
 *
 * @see VuforiaLocalizer
 * @see VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener
 * see  ftc_app/doc/tutorial/FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In order to use this OpMode, you need to obtain your own Vuforia license key as
 * is explained below.

         * the camera resides. These specifications are in the form of <em>transformation matrices.</em>
         * Transformation matrices are a central, important concept in the math here involved in localization.
         * See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix">Transformation Matrix</a>
         * for detailed information. Commonly, you'll encounter transformation matrices as instances
         * of the {@link OpenGLMatrix} class.
         *
         * For the most part, you don't need to understand the details of the math of how transformation
         * matrices work inside (as fascinating as that is, truly). Just remember these key points:
         * <ol>
         *
         *     <li>You can put two transformations together to produce a third that combines the effect of
         *     both of them. If, for example, you have a rotation transform R and a translation transform T,
         *     then the combined transformation matrix RT which does the rotation first and then the translation
         *     is given by {@code RT = T.multiplied(R)}. That is, the transforms are multiplied in the
         *     <em>reverse</em> of the chronological order in which they applied.</li>
         *
         *     <li>A common way to create useful transforms is to use methods in the {@link OpenGLMatrix}
         *     class and the Orientation class. See, for example, {@link OpenGLMatrix#translation(float,
         *     float, float)}, {@link OpenGLMatrix#rotation(AngleUnit, float, float, float, float)}, and
         *     {@link Orientation#getRotationMatrix(AxesReference, AxesOrder, AngleUnit, float, float, float)}.
         *     Related methods in {@link OpenGLMatrix}, such as {@link OpenGLMatrix#rotated(AngleUnit,
         *     float, float, float, float)}, are syntactic shorthands for creating a new transform and
         *     then immediately multiplying the receiver by it, which can be convenient at times.</li>
         *
         *     <li>If you want to break open the black box of a transformation matrix to understand
         *     what it's doing inside, use {@link MatrixF#getTranslation()} to fetch how much the
         *     transform will move you in x, y, and z, and use {@link Orientation#getOrientation(MatrixF,
         *     AxesReference, AxesOrder, AngleUnit)} to determine the rotational motion that the transform
         *     will impart. See {@link #format(OpenGLMatrix)} below for an example.</li>
         *
         * </ol>
         *
         * This example places the "stones" image on the perimeter wall to the Left
         *  of the Red Driver station wall.  Similar to the Red Beacon Location on the Res-Q
         *
         * This example places the "chips" image on the perimeter wall to the Right
         *  of the Blue Driver station.  Similar to the Blue Beacon Location on the Res-Q
         *
         * See the doc folder of this project for a description of the Field Coord System
         * conventions.
         *
         * Initially the target is conceptually lying at the origin of the Field Coord System
         * (the center of the field), facing up.
         *
         * In this configuration, the target's coordinate system aligns with that of the field.
         *
         * In a real situation we'd also account for the vertical (Z) offset of the target,
         * but for simplicity, we ignore that here; for a real robot, you'll want to fix that.

         * We also need to tell Vuforia where the <em>cameras</em> are relative to the robot.
         *
         * Just as there is a Field Coord System, so too there is a Robot Coord System.
         * The two share many similarities. The origin of the Robot Coord System is wherever
         * you choose to make it on the robot, but typically you'd choose somewhere in the middle
         * of the robot. From that origin, the Y axis is horizontal and positive out towards the
         * "front" of the robot (however you choose "front" to be defined), the X axis is horizontal
         * and positive out towards the "right" of the robot (i.e.: 90deg horizontally clockwise from
         * the positive Y axis), and the Z axis is vertical towards the sky.
         *
         * Similarly, for each camera there is a Camera Coord System. The origin of a Camera
         * Coord System lies in the middle of the sensor inside of the camera. The Z axis is
         * positive coming out of the lens of the camera in a direction perpendicular to the plane
         * of the sensor. When looking at the face of the lens of the camera (down the positive Z
         * axis), the X axis is positive off to the right in the plane of the sensor, and the Y axis
         * is positive out the top of the lens in the plane of the sensor at 90 horizontally
         * counter clockwise from the X axis.
         *
         * Next, there is Phone Coord System (for robots that have phones, of course), though
         * with the advent of Vuforia support for Webcams, this coordinate system is less significant
         * than it was previously. The Phone Coord System is defined thusly: with the phone in
         * flat front of you in portrait mode (i.e. as it is when running the robot controller app)
         * and you are staring straight at the face of the phone,
         *     * X is positive heading off to your right,
         *     * Y is positive heading up through the top edge of the phone, and
         *     * Z is pointing out of the screen, toward you.
         * The origin of the Phone Coord System is at the origin of the Camera Coord System
         * of the front-facing camera on the phone.
         *
         * Finally, it is worth noting that trackable Vuforia Image Targets have their <em>own</em>
         * coordinate system (see {@link VuforiaTrackable}. This is sometimes referred to as the
         * Target Coord System. In keeping with the above, when looking at the target in its
         * natural orientation, in the Target Coodinate System
         *     * X is positive heading off to your right,
         *     * Y is positive heading up through the top edge of the target, and
         *     * Z is pointing out of the target, toward you.
         *
         * One can observe that the Camera Coord System of the front-facing camera on a phone
         * coincides with the Phone Coord System. Further, when a phone is placed on its back
         * at the origin of the Robot Coord System and aligned appropriately, those coordinate
         * systems also coincide with the Robot Coord System. Got it?
         *
         * In this example here, we're going to assume that we put the camera on the right side
         * of the robot (facing outwards, of course). To determine the transformation matrix that
         * describes that location, first consider the camera as lying on its back at the origin
         * of the Robot Coord System such that the Camera Coord System and Robot Coord
         * System coincide. Then the transformation we need is
         *      * first a rotation of the camera by +90deg along the robot X axis,
         *      * then a rotation of the camera by +90deg along the robot Z axis, and
         *      * finally a translation of the camera to the side of the robot.
         *
         * When determining whether a rotation is positive or negative, consider yourself as looking
         * down the (positive) axis of rotation from the positive towards the origin. Positive rotations
         * are then CCW, and negative rotations CW. An example: consider looking down the positive Z
         * axis towards the origin. A positive rotation about Z (ie: a rotation parallel to the the X-Y
         * plane) is then CCW, as one would normally expect from the usual classic 2D geometry.
